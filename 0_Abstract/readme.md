# ABSTRACT:
From earlier times, security was and also till now is an issue of concern in our households and also in office, shops, etc.
Everyone has a fear of unauthorized person entering to their home or office without their knowledge.
* The normal door can be fitted
with locks which are capable of breaking with the use of an alternate key. Alternatives to this system can be found like the password
or pattern system in the locks which again has the possibility of getting exposed and opening the lock. So, a solution to such
problems can be by combining door lock with biometrics.

* Biometric verification is any means by which a person can be uniquely
identified by evaluating one or more distinguishing biological traits. 
* Unique identifiers include fingerprints, hand geometry, earlobe
geometry, retina and iris patterns, voice waves, DNA, and signatures. Here we will use fingerprint for biometric verification as it is one
such thing which is unique to every individual and the use of fingerprint as the key to door locks can overcome the security problem
of unauthorized people trespassing to our homes, shops, offices, etc to a great extent as duplicacy in such key is not possible. 
* Also,
this system will not lead to problems like losing keys because we do not require carrying keys if this system is used instead of
traditional locks. So, using arduino we will try to implement the system with feature which will increase the security level.
