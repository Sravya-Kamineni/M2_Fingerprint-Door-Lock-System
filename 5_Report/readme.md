## OBJECTIVES:
* Security has always been a concern of highly importance to humans all around the world. Thanks to technology, the way people guard valuables and their homes have evolved to being safer than ever. In the present time, security involves a wide range of software that includes web based security services, biometrics and personal devices with security levels.


* The introduction of biometrics into security has been one of the greatest advancements of the digital-technical age. Fingerprint door locks are one example of the earliest and most used systems in relation to biometrics.

 
* The fingerprint door lock has a very self-explanatory name, it is a system that allows authorized people access as a result of recognizing their fingerprints, as they are a great method of identification for humans. Human fingerprints have a lot of details and are incredibly unique. In addition it is difficult to try and copy another set of fingerprints, even to fake them and alter them.

 * So, the fact that fingerprints are nearly always unique, makes fingerprint door locking system perfect with regards to security. And of course, you can hardly forget your fingerprints or even have to remember it to always carry it, in comparison to a set of keys.


## ADVANTAGES:

* This project provides security.
* Power consumption is less.
* Used commonly available component.
* Circuit diagram is simple and easy.
* Easy to use and setup.
* Storage of up to 200 fingerprints.
* Generally it is used in ATM, fingerprint car and home door lock etc for security.

## LIMITATIONS: 
* Different biometric technologies need the use of different devices that have a range of cost.
* Entry and delete fingerprints need to operate multiple steps, the program is too much trouble, convenience is not enough.
* Performance can be fluctuate to dry, wet, dirty fingers.
* Population coverage may be a problem with old age people or people with skin disease.

## APPLICATIONS
* Used in Banks and Offices to secure the vaults door or simply for residential houses door lock system.
* Fingerprint security system can be used in ATM, fingerprint operated Vehicles.
Can be used for voter ID registration.

## FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
Advancements in biometric identification management technology are moving so fast, In future we will make advancement and multi functions like sms alert if authorized person try to lock the door .Image reconizing process system and password system based. Also eyes retina for password which helps authorized persons for authentication for entrance so biometric technology makes individual convenient in real life.

## PROBLEM FORMULATION:

* The fingerprint will not work when it is dirty or wait finger.
“Module not detected” problem may occur which can be easily solved by resetting using reset button.


## CONCLUCSION:

Fingerprint door locks are great investment for home or business. It provides great security by providing restrictions to unwanted access. This device increases level of security by adding unique biological features of authorized person. For anyone who wants more security to their homes, fingerprint door locks are best choice.
