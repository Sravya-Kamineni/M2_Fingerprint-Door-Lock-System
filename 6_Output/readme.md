The program developed and loaded on the microcontroller by means of an interfacer known as the programmer.
The program and Hex code is given in appendix.
## Assembler
The assembler used for this project is the MPLAB version 5.7 which was downloaded from the microchip
website. This is windows based integrated development environment (IDE) software which gives support for the
PIC and other microcontrollers. This software contains a full featured editor, three operating modes (editor,
emulator, simulator, a project manager, customizable tool bar and key mapping, status bar with project
information.
* Arduino 1.6.3 allows one to edit source files (either in assembly or ‘C’). Other features include debugging
using:
* Source files
* Absolute listing file
## ARDUINO Programmer
This was used to burn the hex files into the microcontroller. This programmer has the facility to program a
ATMEGA328, erase the EEPROM, and also verify the already written program for errors
