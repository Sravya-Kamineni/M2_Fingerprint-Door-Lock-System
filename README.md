# M2_Fingerprint-Door-Lock-System
## Introduction:
Biometric systems have overtime served as robust security mechanisms in various domains. Fingerprints are the oldest and most widely used form of biometric identification. The use of fingerprint for identification has been employed in law enforcement for about a century. A much broader application of fingerprint is for personal authentication, for instance to access a computer, a network, an ATM machine, a car or a home.

Electronic lock using fingerprint recognition system is a process of verifying the fingerprint image to open the electronic lock. This project highlights the development of fingerprint verification. Verification is completed by comparing the data of authorized fingerprint image with incoming fingerprint image. Then the information of incoming fingerprint image will undergo the comparison process to compare with authorized fingerprint image. 

Fingerprint door lock incorporates the proven technology. Fingerprint reader scanning is the most mature and tested type of biometric technology. Recent studies on biometrics have shown that compared to the hand method, fingerprint is more accurate and cost-effective. The duplication of biometric fingerprint technology is virtually impossible, only one in one billionth of a chance. Biometric security guarantees a positive method of user identification with something that cannot be lost, replicated or stolen.
# Objectives:
* IT security and data protection are crucial factors for business longevity and profitability.
* Every year billions of dollars are spent bolstering corporate IT security to protect companies from potential cyberattacks.

* Since the introduction of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2018, any company that falls foul of a data breach will now face fines of up to €20 million or 4% of its annual turnover. 
* In fact, the biggest fine to date was issued to British Airways in September this year. After the personal data of 500,000 of its customers was leaked from their company website and mobile app, BA was fined a hefty £183 million.
